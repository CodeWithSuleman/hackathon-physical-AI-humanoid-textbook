# Basic Robot Scene (Unity Project Placeholder)

This directory is intended to hold a basic Unity project with a simple robot model.

## Setup Instructions

To properly initialize this as a Unity project:

1.  **Open Unity Hub**: Launch Unity Hub.
2.  **Add Project**: Click on the "Add" button and navigate to this `basic_robot_scene/` directory. Select the folder to add it as an existing project.
3.  **Open Project**: Open the project with a compatible Unity Editor version (e.g., 2022 LTS or newer). Unity will perform initial setup and potentially import assets.
4.  **Install Robotics Packages**: Once the project is open, use the Unity Package Manager (`Window -> Package Manager`) to install the necessary Unity Robotics Packages as outlined in `quickstart.md`.
5.  **Create a Simple Scene**: Create a new scene (e.g., `File -> New Scene`) and save it in `Assets/Scenes/`. Add a ground plane, some lighting, and import a simple 3D robot model (e.g., a basic cube or a simple URDF imported robot).

This `README.md` will guide you through the manual steps required to set up the Unity project within this folder.
